**Computer Science**
*Rising Senior*
I need this class to graduate on time, and am also interested in the intersection of my major with humanities applications.

### Potential Styles of Data Visualizations

1. [Coming to a Screen Near You: How Data Science is Revolutionizing the Film Industry](https://datacolumn.iaa.ncsu.edu/blog/2023/01/30/coming-to-a-screen-near-you-how-data-science-is-revolutionizing-the-film-industry/)
The article interests me because I have always wanted to go into the film industry in a technological way, via animation or some other similar route. Data science is an avenue I had not considered when it came to the industry I hope to join. 
2. ![Graph of circles](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-libraries-data-visualization/5.png)
I like the visualization because of its aesthetically pleasing use of circles, and its use of relative circle size to convey important information about various attributes like frequency, severity, or other such features that can be represented through quantifiable amounts.
